Palatino is the work of designer Hermann Zapf, who is a calligrapher by training. Many of his fonts reflect this influence. But the Palatino ◊xref{system font} is a harsh representation of Zapf’s original design. ◊xref{Palatino Nova} is Zapf’s own reworking of Palatino that restores its original fluid subtlety. ◊xref{Bembo Book} is a revision of the famous 1929 Monotype face, which was itself based on Italian Renaissance typography. Despite the name, so was ◊xref{Iowan Old Style}, but it’s a looser interpretation of that model. The lovely ◊xref{Verdigris} also draws on these influences.

These alternatives apply equally to Book Antiqua, which was created as a Palatino clone for Microsoft Windows. Book Antiqua has caused its share of controversy over the years — Zapf himself considered it an unethical pillaging of his work. But in recent times, the alleged pillager (Monotype) acquired the alleged pillagee (Linotype), extinguishing the beef.
