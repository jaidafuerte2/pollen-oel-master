Calibri does its job better than Cambria, though it’s still better on screen than in print. The rounded corners of the letters make text printed in Calibri seem soft. For a clean, slightly narrow sans serif font, you have better options. ◊xref{Concourse}, of course. ◊xref{FF Unit} is the "grown-up sister" of one of the world's most popular sans serif fonts, FF Meta, and the work of ◊xref{foreword} author Erik Spiekermann. Erik also designed ◊xref{Fira Sans}, also a descendant of FF Meta. Though it has fewer styles than FF Unit, you can't argue with the price: it's free. ◊xref{Whitney} takes inspiration from the famous 1908 face News Gothic, which Calibri resembles.
