It’s counterintuitive, but a well-designed font can have a lot of subtle variation between letters and still look consistent on the page. The converse of this principle is that a font with too much consistency can be numbing to read. Cambria is an example of this problem. It works well on screen, but on the printed page, it induces headaches. ◊xref{Guardian}, ◊xref{Elena}, and ◊xref{Charter} are similar to Cambria but avoid monotony. (Charter is even available for free.) ◊xref{FF Tisa} has a more relaxed, informal rhythm.

    ◊link["https://typekit.com/fonts/source-serif-pro"]{Source Serif Pro} is another very good open-source option. It comes in six weights, but doesn't have italics yet.
