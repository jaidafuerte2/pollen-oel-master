Verdana was designed for the computer displays of the 1990s, so it’s great for the websites of the 1990s. For everything else, not so great. ◊xref{Concourse}, ◊xref{Alright Sans}, ◊xref{Amplitude}, and ◊xref{Colfax} are sans serif fonts that work well in print and on today's screens. Alright is called a ◊em{humanist} sans serif because it relies on the proportions of traditional serif fonts. Amplitude draws from the spirit of ◊em{agates}, newspaper fonts designed to be readable at very small sizes (so it works especially well on ◊xref{business cards}). Colfax is called a ◊em{geometric} sans serif because it’s built on basic mathematical shapes. Concourse is a blend of geometric and humanist.
