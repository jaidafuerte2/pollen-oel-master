◊font-desc{When sans serif fonts emerged in the 19th century, they were used mostly at headline sizes, not ◊xref{body text} sizes. But modern typography uses sans serifs at all sizes. Designs like Arial and Helvetica were meant to be comfortable for extended reading. I abhor Arial — it’s clunky and painfully overexposed. By contrast, ◊xref{Neutral}, ◊xref{Bernini Sans}, and ◊xref{Cooper Hewitt} are new designs that aim for svelte plain-spokenness, but without being bland retreads of earlier designs. Cooper Hewitt, designed for the Smithsonian, is free.}
